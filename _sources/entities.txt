Entity management
=================

In the `home page <TERENAPEERDOMAIN/>`_ of the site there is a link, labelled "Full list of entities", that takes the user to a `paginated list of all entities <TERENAPEERDOMAIN/entity/>`_, regardless of the owner. From this list a user can click on an entity to view its details. If she has rights to do so, in this entity detail page she will be presented, apart form the actual details of the entity, with a link labelled "Remove entity", that enables her to do just that, remove the entity from the system. In the page listing the entities the user is also presented with a link labelled "Add entity", that takes her to a form to create a new entity. In this form she just has to fill in the name of the new entity and select its domain.

XXX the metadata is not yet on the form or the detail page.
